      webmail.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
     GatorMail is the creation of William A. McArthur, Jr. He started a hobby
     project to prototype a webmail that would meet the needs of the University
     of Florida after being disappointed by the then current webmail offerings
     on the market.
