*   In message view show the reply-to header.

*   Spellcheck: Use http://jazzy.sf.net for the engine and GameFaqs.com has
    a reasonablly easy to implement example in their forums.

*   Full message search.

*   Clean up the CSS style sheets. They are a hairball.

*   LoginAction needs to be atomic. Currently it adds things to the session in
    steps which can lead to problems.

*   The way that we use ActionForm beans is broken. It currently works but odds
    are it will break in future versions of Struts.

*   Lots of stuff. Just grep for 'TODO' or 'XXX' in the GatorMail sources.

*   Support RFC2369: http://www.nisto.com/listspec/

*   Support In-Reply-To as per RFC822 and References would be nice.

*   Attach many messages to a message for the purposes of forwarding them.

*   Actually keep messages being composed in a user's Draft folder.

*   Make sure we follow the dvice in IMAP4 Implementation Recommendations:
    http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc2683.html

*   Delete View -  the use of a Trash folder isn't so hot. Simply flagging
    messages as to be deleted in place and providing a "Trash View" would
    probably be better.

*   Make Previous and Next links respect the filter.

*   See if an mime part has a file name, if so, provide a download link.
