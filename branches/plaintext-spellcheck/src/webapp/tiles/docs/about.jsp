<h1>History</h1>

<p>
 In the summer of 2002 William A. McArthur, Jr. was given the task to research
 and find possible replacements for the
 <html:link href="http://jwma.sourceforge.net/">JWMA WebMail</html:link> which
 was the university's main webmail at the time. After extensive testing he was
 unable to find a webmail, either commercial or open source, that met the
 technology requirements, was robust, was efficient about its interaction with
 the mail server, and was likely to scale well for a large user base.
</p>

<p>
 Disappointed with the available choices, William requested to be allowed to
 pursue the project of writing a webmail for the university. At the time the
 resources to commit a staff member to another project were not available. A
 few weeks later William was to take a week long vacation and he claimed he
 could have a working prototype in one weeks worth of effort. Borrowing a
 friend's laptop, quite a bit of progress was made in the Appalachian Mountains
 but by time he came back to work he only had half of a prototype. While he
 didn't reach his original goal, William made enough progress that he wanted to
 finish his project.
</p>

<p>
 In his spare time William made slow progress on what was being called "UFWM".
 "UFWM" was the working title until the project matured enough that it was
 likely to be a success. The name was later changed to GatorMail because it
 sounded more friendly and because the product was to be one of the
 <html:link href="http://gatorlink.ufl.edu/">GatorLink</html:link> services
 available to UF students.
</p>

<p>
 Late in the fall of 2002 William informed his boss, Stephen L. Ulmer, that he
 would be ready for a test deployment on new years day 2003. New years day came
 and went and GatorMail wasn't ready. About the middle of January, Stephen
 offered to allocate resources and the help of an additional programmer. William
 gladly accepted help, and by late January Drake S. Emko joined the
 project. Drake promptly infused GatorMail with his unique brand of
 enthusiasm, as well as a plethora of new code.
</p>

<p>
 During this time meetings to discuss the state of the project and requirements
 of the university were held. It was determined the ideal webmail of one lone
 programmer is very different than the ideal webmail of an entire student
 population. With a defined set of goals Drake and William made quick progress
 implementing a lot of new features and improving functionality in relatively
 little time.
</p>

<p>
 On Feburary 20th 2003, all the features that are considered required for
 public use were implemented. GatorMail was made available to the public as
 a beta product for public review and extended testing. Over the next month we
 received a lot of positive feedback and only three generally negative emails.
 Once again we re-evualated what features were important, this time based on the
 requestes of the public.
</p>

<p>
 Around the start of March, Albert T. Kirby from the
 <html:link href="http://www.webadmin.ufl.edu/">UF Web Administration</html:link>
 created a new look for GatorMail. The clean look of the artwork and the layout
 are all the result of his effort.
</p>

<p>
 Version 1.0.0 of GatorMail was made available to the general public on April
 18th 2003. While not feature complete, this release implements all parts deemed
 necessary for the University of Florida and has no known bugs that can be
 directly attributed to GatorMail.
</p>

<p>
 In the summer of 2003 Raymond Page made thought up the layout and functionality
 of the new compose page and made other contributions to help improve usability.
