<p>
<strong>GatorMail could not find your INBOX.</strong>
</p>

<p>
 It is likely that the mail server is experiencing an
 internal error. Please contact the Help Desk at (352)392-HELP
 or <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ufl.edu">helpdesk@ufl.edu</a>
 if you think this may be the case. If the mail server is temporarily
 down, you may want to <html:link forward="login">log in</html:link>
 again after waiting a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
 It is also possible that you don't have a Gatorlink mailbox.  This is often
 the case when your Gatorlink mail is being forwarded to some other
 account, and your mailbox hasn't yet been created. Alternately, you
 may be a Gatorlink user who doesn't qualify for a mailbox. You may
 edit and view your Gatorlink account information at the
 <html:link href="http://gatorlink.ufl.edu/">Gatorlink account site</html:link>.
