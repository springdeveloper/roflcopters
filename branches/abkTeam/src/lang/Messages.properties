#Labels and messages to be used in the Help page
help.header=GatorMail Help
help.intro=This help page is a work in progress. \
		We will add more answers as people bring us more questions, \
		and as we document GatorMail's features. Thanks for trying GatorMail.
help.answer.composeNewWindow=GatorMail already supports this via your web \
		browser's "Open in New Window" feature. When you "right click" on \
		the compose or reply to links a pop up menu with a choice similar \
		to "Open in New Window" should be available. When you choose this you \
		will be able to compose a message in one window and read or \
		other activities in another window.
help.answer.displayName=Your name is retrieved from UF's directory server. \
		We use the "Display Name" field for both your signature and your name \
		as it appears in the <code>From:</code> field of emails. To change your \
		directory information, please visit UF's \
		<html:link href="http://directory.ufl.edu/edit">directory editing site</html:link>.
help.answer.foldersDisapeared=It is very likely that you need to mark these folders as \
		"Subscribed". Here is how to do this:\
		</p><p>\
		Click on the <html:link forward="folderManage">Manage Folders</html:link> \
		link on the menu bar. From here you can see the subscription status of each \
		of your folders. If the "Subscribed" column is marked "N", click the folder's \
		"Modify Folder" link, and then press the "Subscribe Folder" button on the next page.
help.answer.gl=Contact the Help Desk at (352)392-HELP or <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ufl.edu">helpdesk@ufl.edu</a>.
help.answer.login=First of all, you must have a\
		<html:link href="http://gatorlink.ufl.edu">Gatorlink account</html:link>.\
		Make sure you	are entering your user ID like "gatorfan" , not like\
		"gatorfan@ufl.edu" or anything that is not your user ID that you\
		picked when you set up your account. It should be in all lower-case\
		letters, and make sure you aren't including any spaces before or after\
		your user ID. Your password is case sensitive, so make sure you are\
		typing it exactly correctly. If you forgot your password or have any\
		other problems with your account contact the Help Desk at 392-HELP or\
		<html:link href="mailto:helpdesk@ufl.edu">helpdesk@ufl.edu</html:link>.
help.answer.noINBOX=It is possible that you don't have a Gatorlink mailbox. \
		This is often the case when your Gatorlink mail is being \
		forwarded to some other account, and your mailbox hasn't yet \
		been created. Alternately, you may be a Gatorlink user who \
		doesn't qualify for a mailbox. You may edit and view your \
		Gatorlink account information at the \
		<html:link href="http://gatorlink.ufl.edu/">Gatorlink account site</html:link>. \
		</p><p>\
		It is also possible that the mail server is experiencing an \
		internal error. Please contact the Help Desk at (352)392-HELP \
		or <html:link href="mailto:helpdesk@ufl.edu">helpdesk@ufl.edu</html:link> \
		if you think this may be the case.
help.answer.open=If you still have questions, or would like to report a problem, use the \
		<html:link forward="feedback">Send Feedback</html:link> at the top of most \
		pages or you can ask for support at \
        <html:link href="http://GatorMail.sf.net/support">http://GatorMail.sf.net/support</html:link>.
help.answer.pagination=GatorMail currently does not support paginating the \
		list of messages when viewing a folder. This feature is on our short \
		list of features to implement.
help.answer.sentMail=You need to click the "Copy message to Sent folder" check box next the "Send" button.
help.answer.subscribed=GatorMail uses the \
		<html:link href="http://www-camis.stanford.edu/projects/imap/ml/imap.html">IMAP</html:link>\
		protocol to interact with the Gatorlink mail server. In IMAP, a folder may be marked \
		subscribed or unsubscribed, and mail clients may treat each type of folder differently. \
		GatorMail allows you to set the subscribed status of your folders, and will ignore (not \
		display) unsubscribed folders, except in the "Manage Folders" page.
help.answer.userInfoException=This error indicates that GatorMail couldn't find your \
		entry in the <html:link href="http://phonebook.ufl.edu/">UF Directory</html:link>. \
		GatorMail uses the directory to get your display name and your UF ID, \
		which it uses internally. \
		</p><p>\
		People commonly get this error if they have very recently registered into the \
		GatorLink system. The UF Directory pulls information from the registration \
		database overnight, so if you have registered earlier in the day, \
		please try logging onto GatorMail the next morning. \
		</p><p>\
		Also, it is possible that this error represents a transient lookup glitch. \
		You may be able to log in successfully after waiting a short while. \
		However, if you keep getting this error, and you know you have a UF Directory \
		entry, please report the problem to the Help Desk at (352)392-HELP \
		or <html:link href="mailto:helpdesk@ufl.edu">helpdesk@ufl.edu</html:link>.

help.question.composeNewWindow=Could you make it so that when I compose a message it opens in a new window?
help.question.displayName=Where do my display name and signature come from? Why are they all capital letters?
help.question.foldersDisapeared=Why can't I see some of my folders? I know they exist, but GatorMail doesn't show them.
help.question.gl=I have a question that is not specific to the Webmail system, like mail forwarding or other general Gatorlink questions.
help.question.login=I can't log in.
help.question.noINBOX=I get a "Couldn't find folder" error for INBOX when I log in.
help.question.open=None of these questions help with my GatorMail specific problem. How do I get a hold of you guys?
help.question.pagination=How do I limit how many messages are shown in the message listing?
help.question.sentMail=Why are my messages not being stored in my Sent folder?
help.question.subscribed=What does the "Subscribed" column signify on the "Manage Folders" page?
help.question.userInfoException=I get a "Could not access required user information" error when I try to log in.
